This project was inspired by DIYLC, with the main difference being that this project is compatable on all devices as long as they have a web broswer. As this project is currently being supported by a small group of people and developed by a single developer, lots of features are being worked on. As it stands a basic circuit can be created from start to finish.",

That way I would never have to create a reference list ever again. Plus if any person asks how I know the random facts I know, I can actually point them to somewhere. This website is purely for fun and was used as a website to improve my Javascript and CSS skills. All the links on this website are sorted alphabetically.",
