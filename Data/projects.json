    "paragraph": "Since my inline 3 engine model project I wanted to design a new model engine that could run under some sort of energ other than a hand crank. I was unsure what energy to base my new engine model off of until I saw a video by PolyProject3D on YouTube. He has made a collection of 3D printed engines that all run off of compressed air. The specific engine that peaked my interest is the V8 model engine he made. \n\n The reason why his V8 model engine intrigued me the most was because of the intricate intake and exhause manifolds he designed. The manifolds and the performance of the engine lead me to be reminded of the Lexus LFA due to its high revving nature and unique sound characteristic. Due to this I decided I would design my own version of the engine PolyProject3D made but in V10 form in inspiration from the LFA. I figured it would be the perfect project to learn how to manufacture more detailed and stress-enduring part using SLM printing. \n\n This project is quickly growing in scope as I think this engine could be paired to an entire system of 3D printed drivetrain components to form an entire functioning(ish) model car. So far I have the engine mated to a transmission and a differential.",

    "paragraph": "The battle bot I built for the 2024 season was designed off of a year of experience where I learnt everything from where to buy affordable fasteners to how to best design a frame to resist attack. The robot for the 2024 season was completely redesigned from the ground up to prioritize frame rigidity, value, and fairness first. I decided to consider value and fairness as integral aspects because I could transfer what I thought was fair into the parts I was tasked with buying for the 2024 season. I needed to make sure that the parts I decided to buy were easy to learn with, effective in battle bots, but also effective for other activies (i.e. drones). I also needed to ensure that the teams could fairly compete no matter what skill level and budget at hand. \n\nThe reason why this specifically spoke to me is because I felt that the 2023 season was unfair due to the wide range of budget, team sizes, and robot sizes. There were no standards in the 2023 season and due to that there were problems with some teams winning due to non-skill based factors. There was also no defined scoring system which meant teams were blindly going into the competition not knowing how a winner would be decided. These were all issues that were remedied in the 2024 season. I supplied fasteners to whomever needed them, often helped mentoring with the design of other robots, 3D printing parts for other people when I could, designed rules to consider all aspects of battle (as to deter boring metas from forming), and I generally helped teams troubleshoot their bots. I felt I had a lot more fun in the 2024 season and I hope a lot of other people did too as that is how I would measure my success. \n\n My battle bot had the following specs:\n- 4 1/2\" saw blade\n- Drone motor driven by a D2822 ESC (weapon)\n- Dual 25GA-370 drive motors driven by an L298N\n- Arduino Uno\n- Bluetooth receiver (smartphone control)\n- 50mm computer fan for cooling",

As this project is currently being supported by a small group of people and developed by a single developer, lots of features are being worked on. As it stands a basic circuit can be created from start to finish. The biggest change that needs to be made is an improvement to the current control scheme. Everything in this app is done through they keyboard which is the biggest suggested category of change given by the alpha-testers. The control system in the future will be able to integrate the mouse to click and drag components around.\n\nThe entire web-app is programmed in Javascript utilizing easy to read JSON files and custom component files to draw the components on the canvas.",
